Introduction of experiential multi-sensory stimulation presents great potential to overcome the behavioral and health
performance challenges induced by social distancing, isolation and confinement. 

The proposed framework integrates various stimuli inputs, such as, auditory, tactile, visual, olfactory and gustatory, 
to enhance life experiences and re-enforce interpersonal connectedness.

The proposed solution demonstrates great potential to benefit people in global communities and in outer space.
